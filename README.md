# Pokemons App API

## `Notes on API`

I used Laravel Sactum to implement the API. 

Below are the list of items thatI will like to add to improve the application:

1. Write test cases for the API endpoints.
2. I will implement an endpoint that handles the editing of the pokemons. 
3. I will implement a feature on the API that will enable users to keep track of other users that had updated a Pokemon. That means for each Pokemon, other users will be able to see a log or history of changes that where made on a Pokemon. 
4. I will implement email verification to ensure that only users with valid email addresses will be able to login and make changes to the list of Pokemons.
