# Pokemons App API

## `Notes on API`

I used Laravel Sactum to implement the API. 

Below are the list of items thatI will like to add to improve the application:

1. Write test cases for the API endpoints.
2. I will implement an endpoint that handles the editing of the pokemons. 
3. I will implement a feature on the API that will enable users to keep track of other users that had updated a Pokemon. That means for each Pokemon, other users will be able to see a log or history of changes that where made on a Pokemon. 
4. I will implement email verification to ensure that only users with valid email addresses will be able to login and make changes to the list of Pokemons.
5. I will add reset password for users who forgot their password. 
6. On the admin dashboard, I will add a change password page for users who wish to change their password to something else.  
7. I will add something like a subscribe feature on the API that will enable users to select a couple of Pokemons that they would like to recieve email notifications whenever any changes are made on the selected Pokemons.
